## What is Drawdown?
Drawdown in finance refers to the peak-to-trough decline during a specific recorded period of an investment, a trading account, or a fund. It is usually quoted as the percentage between the peak and the subsequent trough. If a trading account has $10,000 at the peak and then drops to $9,000 before rising again, the drawdown is 10%. Drawdowns are important for measuring the historical risk of different investments, comparing fund performance, or monitoring personal trading performance. A key goal in finance is to minimize drawdowns to preserve capital and ensure a smoother investment growth trajectory.
